Understanding basic formatting, setting attributes, linking etc in HTML from https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

Icons, Images and content are from my existing portfolio (previous work experience)

Project 1 : Sonic Design System  - Has two projects within it

Project 2 : SportsDapp - An app more focused on visual appeal

Project 3 : Document Revamp -  A link to an external documentation of a case study

For the portoflio the language I have mainly used HTML, CSS and JS

The design and structure was first done on Figma to understand how to compose each section and pages. The inspect option on figma enables you to copy few CSS 
that is automatically generated, which helped understand how to code the initial transform animation on landing.
